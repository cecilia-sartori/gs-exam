# The worst neighborhood to be a Woman in Mexico City

This repo serves as source for maintaining the final assignment for Geospatial Analysis course page and contains all the source code files for reproducing it. See the whole project here https://cecilia-sartori.github.io/gs-exam/

This project aims to map violence against women (VAW) in Mexico City neighborhoods and identify what areas are most at risk within the city. After a brief introduction on VAW rates in the world, it will evaluate the spatial dependence between geographic locations of reported cases by using a smaller spatial unit, the census blocks (AGEB). In conclusion, it will investigate access to womenâ€™s shelters by computing average travel distance from place of living.


# How to Run the Project

The files are written in Python using Jupyter Notebooks. All notebooks for Colab environment are located in Colab-folder and all notebooks for running the project on your machine are located in notebooks-folder.
Docs-folder is set as GitHub page source.

The files must be executed in a specific order, and each has a goal:

0. datasets: data pre-processing
1. intro: plot choropleth map with no geoinformation
2. mapping: create interactive map
3. spatialCorr: prove spatial dependence
4. street Network: compute distance in a graph


## Running in Google Colab

This option requires you to have a Google account. 
Navigate to the folder 'Colab'. For any `.ipynb` extension file in file list, copy and paste GitHub URL to the Open Notebook from Github functionality provided by [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

In Colab, you can pass on the order of the files.  


## Running on Your Own Machine

First you need to clone the repo: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cecilia-sartori/gs-exam.git
```

### Requirements ###

Install all the packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download Dataset Locally ###

Because of GitHub size limitation in uploading files, some data need to be downloaded from the original source.
Run `run_local.ipynb` as first step. Then follow the order described. 
You can skip the pre-processing stage (`0_datasets.ipynb`) since all intermediate outputs are stored in the notebooks/data folder.
